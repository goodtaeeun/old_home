about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hi, my name's Tae Eun. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in computer science. Learning new things and sharing them is my greatest pleasure! I think research is taking a step further, which is to make/discover new knowledge for the sake of everyone who will benefit from it.

  I am interested in : <mark>Software Engineering</mark> and <mark>Automatic Program Repair</mark>

          I worked on this project in my undergraduate years. This is an automatic program repair tool, enhanced with a patch recommendation technique to produce patches to fix bugs automatically. The link above will lead you to a page where you can try to fix the bugs from the dataset I used for the validation of the tool. Moreover, you can try to fix a bug from your own repository if you give the necessary information. If you are interested, go check out the website!

            I had a chance to work on a research project as a memeber of ISEL. In ISEL, I learned the most basic skills for research, such as searching for a literature I need, reading it, and understanding it.

          Located in Pohang city, South Korea, Handong is a where I discovered the joy of learning.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at Handong I studied not only computer science but counseling psychology too. This helped me have an understanding of both computers and humans. Understanding both the program and the person that writes/uses/fixes it will help to have a wider viewpoint. I also had a chance to co-work with various people, including team projects, research projects, and school events. This gave me experience with working efficiently with other people to achieve a common goal.

          I spent a lot of my free time in club activities, which were [acapella club](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG3D08O95Wc9cvRap5FKhSg) and judo club.
